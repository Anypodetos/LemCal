# LemCal
This is an Android app that provides, for no good reason, a real-time clock and calendar for the fictional Lemizh world,
which is the home of my constructed language. You can find out all about Lemizh at https://lemizh.conlang.org.

See also the [Time](https://lemizh.conlang.org/appendix/time.php) and [Date](https://lemizh.conlang.org/appendix/date.php) pages on the Lemizh website.
